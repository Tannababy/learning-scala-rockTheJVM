## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways 

- Everything in Scala is an expression 
- Recursion over loops
- All "operators" are methods
- String interpolation: s, f, raw
- Infix notation allows for methods with 1 parameter to be written like natural langauge (object method parameter)
- Unary operators are the same as prefix notation, it only works with (+, -, !, ~)
- Postfix notation is only used with methods that have no parameters
- Apply() allows for objects to be called like a method
